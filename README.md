## Phase 1: Data Profiling & Completeness Checks

This phase focused on establishing a baseline understanding of the dataset’s structural integrity and completeness. Key activities included table-level profiling, null value analysis across critical transactional and dimensional fields, identifier completeness checks, and temporal coverage validation.

A continuous date completeness check confirmed full daily coverage between the minimum and maximum transaction dates, indicating no missing transaction dates. This ensures reliable trend and time-series analysis in downstream reporting.
